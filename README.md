# FidArc Mobile

The goal is to create an application to facilitate the creation of loyalty programs for small companies while limiting the printing of loyalty cards. The application would offer 2 different angles, one focused on companies and the other on customers. The goal here is also to limit the number of registrations a customer will need to make by limiting his identifier to something unique that will identify him to all partners.

Companies and customers would have an Android application, it would allow the customer to have their id and details of the different loyalty programs as well as the possibility to find on an interactive map the position of the participating companies. For companies, it would allow them to consult their customer base and scan the customer's id, in order to increment their "points" counter, either by entering the amount or by automatically incrementing it. If the customer goes to an establishment without having a loyalty card on his phone and he scans it with his smartphone, the card is automatically added to his cell phone.

Companies would also have access to a more complete management interface on their website with the possibility to send emails to customers who would have requested it (update of products from a small bulk grocery store, return of stock, thank you, etc...). The customer could also consult their loyalty cards via the web interface.
